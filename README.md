# ESP-Rust Examples

This repository contains examples of Rust programs designed to run on ESP microcontrollers. The examples demonstrate how to use the [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) ecosystem to develop applications for ESP32 chips.

## Projects Included

### DHT11 Demo
A demo project that reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor.

### LED Control
A simple LED control example that demonstrates basic GPIO operations.

## Prerequisites

- Rust programming language installed
- ESP development tools (ESP-IDF or esp-hal)
- Appropriate chip support for compilation

## How to Use

Each subdirectory contains a complete Rust project. Navigate to the desired example and follow the instructions in its respective README file.
